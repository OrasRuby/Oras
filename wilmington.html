    <h2>Wilmington Beach</h2>
    <p>
       Wilmington Beach was a coastal unincorporated community on Pleasure Island in North Carolina, U.S.[1] that was annexed by the town of Carolina Beach in 2000. Prior to the annexation, the small community was a buffer between Carolina Beach and Kure Beach. U.S. Highway 421 and Ocean Boulevard are the major roads through the area. Its name is derived from the city of Wilmington, North Carolina, which lies approximately ten miles to the north.
        The annexed area consists almost entirely of residential housing.
