    <h2>Clingmans Dome Hike</h2>
    <p>
        At 6,643 feet, Clingmans Dome boasts the highest point in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The “Dome” refers to the mountaintop, not the man-made observation tower. The Dome actually lies within both Tennessee and North Carolina and is the highest point in Tennessee. On clear days, visitors may see as far as 100 miles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clingmans Dome, open year-round, can be reached by traveling Clingmans Dome Road, which closes December 1 through March 31 and when conditions become unfavorable due to ice and snow. At the end of Clingmans Dome Road is the parking area, a visitor’s center and the trailhead to the summit.
        The trail to the reach the park’s highest point is paved and only measures one-half mile.
